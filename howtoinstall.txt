YOUR FIRST PODHAWK INSTALLATION
================================

1) Transfer all files and folders to the desired location on your server.

2) Open "[www.your_podhawk_site.com]/install.php"  in your browser.

3) Follow the instructions there.

4) Delete "install.php" after a successful installation!



YOU WANT TO COUNT YOUR FEED DOWNLOADS?
======================================

1) Check that you have copied the file ".htaccess" to the root directory of your PodHawk installation.

2) If you can't see it - well, it's a hidden file! You may have to enable "show hidden files" in your FTP programme.

3) It must contain the following :

<<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
Options +FollowSymLinks
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^pod/(.+)$ get.php?pod=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^fla/(.+)$ get.php?fla=$1 [L]
RewriteRule ^web/(.+)$ get.php?web=$1 [L]
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule .* rewrite.php [L] 
</IfModule>
