Feb-02-2021: Old RSS Podcasting Software.

This is a 2012 open source project formerly on SourceForge 
called Podhawk used succesfully for a long
time by me to maintain audio archives for RSS retrieval at a community radio
station I volunteer at: kvmr.org
It required php 5.x & MySQL 5.x

The Website http://www.podhawk.com/ has had no updates in a long time-
since 2014 in fact-  & this initial repository, 1.85, is the last known 
revision of the software.

I contacted the last known manager of the codebase, Peter, at that site for
permission to put this out on Github to get development rolling again.

Main Problem: Flash Player was used for Audio. Need HTML5.
Everyone's using php 7.x now so some code is depracated or causes errors.

I am a novice on GITHUB who makes plenty of
clones but has so far not been a contributor not project lead of any project.

I hope this will Change : )- Your input is more than Welcomed!
