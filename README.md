This is a 2012 opensource project called Podhawk used succesfully for a long
time to maintain audio archvoes for RSS retrieval at a community radio
station I volunteer at: kvmr.org

The Website http://www.podhawk.com/ has had no updates in a long time-
since 2014 in fact-  & this initial repository, 1.85 is the last known 
revision of the software.

I contacted the last known manager of the codebase, Peter, at that site for
permission to put this out on Github to get development rolling again.

Main Problem: Flash Player was used for Audio.
obviouly now retired and my efforts to enable HTML5 Playback have been
troubled, to say the least... I am a novice on GITHUB who makes plenty of
clones but has so far not been a contributor not project lead of any project.

I hope this will Change : )- Your input is more thatn Welcomed!
